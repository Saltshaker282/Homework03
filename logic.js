//then once value and option for characters are in, we need to find a way to put it into a value 
//once in a value, we need to display it to the user
//once the password is generated, only then will we worry about buttons

//assuming we succeed with making the password generate, only then will we make the process for generating tied to a button with eventlisteners
//once done, then we can figure out how to copy it to a clipboard
//if all the above steps are completed, basic parameters have been completed and I can fucking relax.
